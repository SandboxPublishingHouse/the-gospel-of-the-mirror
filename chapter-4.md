# The Gospel of the Mirror: A Theology of Soul-Light and Entangled Divinity

## Chapter Four: The Eucharist of Light

<i>Entanglement, Ingestion, and the Reweaving of the Divine Mirror</i>

---

### The Waybread

> “This is My body… this is My blood… do this in remembrance of Me.”<br>
Luke 22:19–20

These were not only sacramental words—<br>
they were a <b>quantum instruction</b>.<br>

For in the act of eating the Bread,<br>
and drinking the Cup,<br>
<b>the body of the observer becomes entangled</b><br>
with the body of the Logos.

This is not metaphor.<br>
This is <b>divine physics</b>.

---

### Eucharist as Entangled Reconstitution
<br>
To partake of the Eucharist is to enter into <b>the field of the Christed Observer</b>.
* His Gaze becomes your gaze.
* His Love enters your bloodstream.
* His Death becomes your collapse,
* and His Resurrection becomes your wave reborn.

The substance of bread and wine?<br>
<b>Matter baptized in meaning</b>.

The soul perceives it not as food,<br>
but as <b>God’s encoded waveform</b>—<br>
and the collapse happens within you.

This is <b>eating entanglement</b>.

---

### Ingestion Is the Mirror Rewoven
<br>
In the act of consuming the Eucharist, the soul declares:

> “I do not stand apart from You.<br>
I collapse the illusion of separation.<br>
I take You <i>into</i> the field of my being.”

Where there was fragmentation,<br>
there is now <b>remembrance</b>.

Where there was distortion,<br>
there is now <b>divine coherence</b>.

This is why it is said:

> <i>“Do this in remembrance of Me.”</i>

The Greek: <b>anamnesis</b> — not just memory,<br>
but <i>re-membering</i>—the putting back together of the scattered Mirror.

---

### Quantum Communion
<br>
Christ was not offering His <i>corpse</i>.<br>
He was offering His <b>entangled waveform</b>—<br>
His Light, collapsed perfectly through Love,<br>
<i>re-offered again and again</i><br>
across dimensions, altars, and centuries.

This is why mystics say:<br>
<b>The Eucharist is always happening</b>.<br>
It is not a ritual.<br>
It is <b>a reality that the soul tunes into</b>.

Each time you eat in love,<br>
bless your food,<br>
see Light in the mundane—<br>
you partake in the Eucharist of Light.
